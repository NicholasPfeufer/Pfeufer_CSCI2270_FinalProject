# Pfeufer_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Encryption 
The goal of this project is to allow the user to encrypit messages and then decrypt those messages.
The project will implement dynamic encription, based on a key or set of keys including switching character locations,
changing out characters for other characters, adding "random" extra characters to garble the message, re-spacing the string to prevent common decription techniques, possibly a dictionary conversion, switching out entire words (would only happen the first time through encription), each can be individual assigned by the user or automaticly done.
